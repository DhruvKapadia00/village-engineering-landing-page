            <h2>Try Village for yourself</h2>
            <p>See how Village can help your team find information instantly</p>
        </div>

## Development Notes

### Server Setup
- The site is served locally using Python's HTTP server on port 8000:
  ```
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```

### Design Decisions
1. **CSS Scaling vs. Individual Adjustments**:
   - Used CSS transform scaling to maintain proportions across all elements
   - This approach preserves the original design while making it more compact

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Maintained responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes
   - Added specific adjustments for mobile views

3. **Visual Representation**:
   - Emphasized showing rather than telling about Village's capabilities
   - Used the PR review example to visually demonstrate functionality

### Known Issues and Considerations
- When making further adjustments, be careful with the scaling as it affects all child elements
- The PNG logo needs to be maintained for proper display
- Ensure the demo fits on screen without scrolling at 100% browser zoom

## Next Steps
1. **Testing**: Verify the layout across different browsers and screen sizes
2. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on the new compact layout
3. **Potential Enhancements**: Consider additional visual examples or interactive elements
